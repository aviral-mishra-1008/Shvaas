<h4>
We are a team of class 12th students who decided to make a CBSE-board project on Django web framework and as a result of that incident, the team of Tails avish was born. The name has a very interesting story behind it: Tails comes from the fact that our team was decided by a coin toss in which tails helped us form this team and avish is made out of the initials of our names. Now, we started initially as a single page E-commerce website and as project advanced we expanded the project into multi page website, we had decided to name each component of our website in sanskrit words, honoring the mother language, as a direct consequence we named this website as Shvaas
<br>
In Sanskrit, breath is called Shvaas so here it sybolizes the importance of the e-commerce website in our daily lives, the Django-app holding this website is called Vyas, Vyas in sanskrit means compiler (hence Ved Vyas was compiler of Vedas, actually Ved Vyas was a post and the rishi who wrote Mahabharat held the post of Ved Vyas), so Vyas/ is the url of page that compiles all other segments and presents to you
<br>
On this website you can find a wide range of products, you will land at the home page as you open the website and you'll see a carousel of categories under which products are available at our website and you can similarly explore the website and enjoy the animations and experience.
