We were able to integrate the PayTm UPI but since we are minors and do not have a pan card or e-kyc, so we were not able to integrate the UPI successfully into our website, we plan to add the payment gateway once we turn 18 years old, until that time please refer to the only viable method available with us, that's COD or cash on delivery!
